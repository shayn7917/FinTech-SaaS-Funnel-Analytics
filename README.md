ðŸ“Š SaaS Funnel Analytics Project

ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project simulates a FinTech SaaS user funnel and analyzes stage-wise drop-offs using:

Python â†’ generated synthetic funnel event logs

MySQL â†’ ETL and funnel transformation queries

Power BI â†’ interactive funnel dashboard and KPIs

The goal is to show end-to-end data analytics workflow: data ingestion â†’ transformation â†’ metrics â†’ visualization â†’ business recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

Synthetic dataset of 5,000 orders, each going through different funnel stages:

Created â†’ Interacted â†’ Login Attempt â†’ Login Success â†’ MFA â†’ Completed

Possible outcomes: Error, Timeout, Cancelled, Churned

File: data/Funnel_Logs.csv

ðŸ”¹ SQL Logic
1. Create Table

  sql/create_table.sql

2. Map Funnel Stages

  sql/stage_mapping.sql

Maps raw status codes into StageLevels (Created=0, Interacted=1, Completed=7, etc.).

3. Funnel KPIs

  sql/funnel_mapping.sql

Computes:

Activation Rate = Interacted Ã· Created

Login Success Rate = Login Success Ã· Login Attempted

Completion Rate = Completed Ã· Interacted

Pullthrough Rate = Completed Ã· Created

4. Power BI Query

  sql/powerbi_query.sql

Outputs stage counts, ready for Power BI funnel charts.

ðŸ”¹ Business Insights

Severe Funnel Drop-off:

Out of 5000 created orders, only 2 reached completion.

Thatâ€™s a completion rate of just 0.04%, highlighting a critical leakage.

High Early Engagement, Poor Conversion:

2484 users interacted, meaning almost 50% engagement rate.

But only 411 attempted login (~16%), showing a big gap between interest and action.

Authentication Bottleneck:

135 successful logins out of 411 attempts â†’ 32.85% login success rate.

Suggests users are struggling at the login stage (bad UX, errors, or mistrust).

MFA Stage is a Major Barrier:

Only 74 users reached MFA out of 135 logins â†’ ~55% drop-off.

Security is important, but this friction is killing conversions.

Pull-through Rate is Critically Low:

Only 0.08% of users who interacted completed the funnel.

Indicates urgent need for product and onboarding optimization.


ðŸ”¹ How to Run Locally

Create schema in MySQL:

Run 01_create_table.sql

Import data/Funnel_Logs.csv into FunnelLogs table

Run queries in sql/02_stage_mapping.sql â†’ sql/03_funnel_metrics.sql

Connect Power BI to MySQL or use 04_powerbi_query.sql directly
