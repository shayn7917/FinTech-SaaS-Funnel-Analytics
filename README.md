ðŸ“Š SaaS Funnel Analytics Project
ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project simulates a FinTech SaaS user funnel and analyzes stage-wise drop-offs using:

Python â†’ generated synthetic funnel event logs

MySQL â†’ ETL and funnel transformation queries

Power BI â†’ interactive funnel dashboard and KPIs

The goal is to show end-to-end data analytics workflow: data ingestion â†’ transformation â†’ metrics â†’ visualization â†’ business recommendations.

ðŸ”¹ Dataset

Synthetic dataset of 5,000 orders, each going through different funnel stages:

Created â†’ Interacted â†’ Login Attempt â†’ Login Success â†’ MFA â†’ Completed

Possible outcomes: Error, Timeout, Cancelled, Churned

File: data/Funnel_Logs.csv

ðŸ”¹ SQL Logic
1. Create Table

sql/create_table.sql

2. Map Funnel Stages

sql/stage_mapping.sql

Maps raw status codes into StageLevels (Created=0, Interacted=1, Completed=7, etc.).

3. Funnel KPIs

sql/funnel_mapping.sql

Computes:

Activation Rate = Interacted Ã· Created

Login Success Rate = Login Success Ã· Login Attempted

Completion Rate = Completed Ã· Interacted

Pullthrough Rate = Completed Ã· Created

4. Power BI Query

sql/powerbi_query.sql

Outputs stage counts, ready for Power BI funnel charts.

ðŸ”¹ Power BI Dashboard

ðŸ”¹ Business Insights

~50% of orders activate after signup â†’ onboarding works well.

Only ~33% of login attempts succeed â†’ major friction at login.

Completion is <1% â†’ MFA and VOIE are strong bottlenecks.

Recommendation: simplify login/MFA, improve UX in verification flow to reduce drop-offs.


ðŸ”¹ How to Run Locally

Create schema in MySQL:

Run 01_create_table.sql

Import data/Funnel_Logs.csv into FunnelLogs table

Run queries in sql/02_stage_mapping.sql â†’ sql/03_funnel_metrics.sql

Connect Power BI to MySQL or use 04_powerbi_query.sql directly
